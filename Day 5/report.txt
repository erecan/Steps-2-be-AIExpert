I gave break to theorical part of AI and started to study ML from Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow by Aurélien Géron.
Notes:
1.
Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

Machine Learning systems can be classified according to the amount and type of supervision they get during training. There are four major categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semisupervised learning, and Reinforcement Learning.
    supervised learning: In supervised learning, the training data you feed to the algorithm includes the desired solutions, called labels
        Here are some of the most important supervised learning algorithms:
            • k-Nearest Neighbors
            • Linear Regression
            • Logistic Regression
            • Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
            • Decision Trees and Random Forests
            • Neural networks
    
    unsupervised learning: In unsupervised learning the training data is unlabeled
        • Clustering
            — k-Means
            — Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA)
            — Expectation Maximization
        • Visualization and dimensionality reduction
            — Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
            — Kernel PCA
            — Locally-Linear Embedding (LLE)
            — t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
        • Association rule learning
            — Apriori
            — Eclat
    
    semisupervised learning: Some algorithms can deal with partially labeled training data, usually a lot of unlabeled data and a little bit of labeled data. This is called semisupervised learning

    Reinforcement Learning is a very different beast. The learning system, called an agent in this context, can observe the environment, select and perform actions, and get rewards in return (or penalties in the form of negative rewards). It must then learn by itself what is the best strategy, called a policy, to get the most reward over time. A policy defines what action the agent should choose when it is in a given situation.
